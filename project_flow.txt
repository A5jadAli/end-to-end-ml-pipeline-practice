Building Pipeline:
> Crrate a Github repo and clone it in your local (add a folder named experiments that will contain initial data and notebook)
> Add src folder along with all components (run them individually)
> Add data, model, reports directories to .gitignore file
> Now git add, commit, push

Setting up dvc pipeline (without params):
> Create dvc.yaml file and add stages to it
> "dvc init" then do "dvc repro" to test the pipeline automation (do "dvc dag" to see how your pipeline components are connected)
> Now git add, commit, push

Setting up dvc pipeline (with params)
> add params.yaml file
> Add the params setup (mentioned below)
> do "dvc repro" again to test the pipeline with params
> Now git, commit, push
